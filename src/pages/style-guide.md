excerpt: It all started in September 2020
---
According to me, setting up a business (Milk dairy) in my hometown was a great opportunity for me.
A product/service that is being produced at one site and is not available to far location due to less transport channels. For example:-In my homeplace people have to travel a lot to get milk and dairy products from dairy and I could import that product /service and could start up my own business that could be beneficial for town people as well as profitable for me.
The most important source of idea for these business has originated from many locals complaining about trouble of travelling to far dairy for getting many of the dairy products. We should understand what customers want, where they want it, how and when they want a product or service to be supplied and the quality of the product and at a reasonable price. 
After a survey I can start to plan for that business where I can fulfill customer’s needs as well as think of many more ideas to expand this business idea to another level.
