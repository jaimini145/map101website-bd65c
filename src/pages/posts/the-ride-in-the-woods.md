  In every company, financial planning is a vital activity. It is the mechanism
  by which financial resources are prepared, coordinated, managed and monitored
  in order to achieve organizational goals and objectives.   It is an ideal

Financial management is essential to the success of any organization, particularly in agriculture where there are so many factors beyond the control of the farmer (weather, prices, yields, etc.). 
Farm financial management means, in its simplest form, balancing the use of limited capital in a way that maximizes returns and benefits. It needs information, experience and access to the industry and the sector.
To maximize its capacity to produce and increase income over the long term, a dairy farm must allocate capital. In order to remain in business and strengthen its capacity and growth, the company must also invest in long-term solvency and profitability. To do so it is necessary to ensure that the financial aspects of your activities are well handled (e.g. money management, expenditures, assets, etc.).
Financial strategies are mainly to determine how, where and why money should be spent on business operations. Financial planning also allows for goals to be set for the farm. Lastly, it provides investors with an assurance that their assets are used responsibly by accurate internal audited financial statements.
