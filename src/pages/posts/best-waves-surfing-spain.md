The most important point to take into consideration for making a video viral depends on how much the targeted audience likes it. So, the said video should have a content which appeals to targeted audience i.e. connect to their daily lifestyle or video should have something that is funny or something people can connect to their real life. Nowadays for getting a video viral, social media plays a vital role for sharing videos to the most people we can pay some amount to the popular pages having most followers to share our videos so it can reach to maximum people. Additionally, social media gives instance response to customers having issues about product or any services. Social networking is becoming one of the most essential aspects of digital marketing that by reaching millions of people worldwide, offers amazing benefits. They help in communicating, increase awareness of your brand, and improve sales.
So, as per my views making videos viral with the help of social media will have a great enhancement to marketing. Because nowadays people are more engaged in mobile phones or gadgets where they can receive all new updates through social media, usually distributing papers or printing in newspaper doesnâ€™t work more effective.
