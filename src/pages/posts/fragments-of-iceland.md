First, important aspect is to maintain good relations with customers insuring they are satisfied with the products and services provided. Our goal is to provide sustainable wealth to our stakeholders by giving them best quality food and at affordable prices. Other than that, we minimise food waste across the system.
Succession all depends on quality. Moreover, adding new technologies, training workers to give their best output, plans and manage for succession. The cost of livestock, milk production levels and even weather conditions can all have an impact on income.
Additionally, with taking care of customers and staff in the company it is very necessary to keep in mind about animals too who contributes for our company, we respect and care for animals(cows) working for our produce. It’s an important part of a dairy farmer’s job to make sure their cows are calm and comfortable.
With a leading position in dairy company we are thinking to expand our company with new segment and building up new branches also.
