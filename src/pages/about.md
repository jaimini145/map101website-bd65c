It has variety of products according to the taste and means of customers like: milk,butter ,ghee,milk powder,panner,cheese,ice-creams ,chocolates and many more.

In the urban, the organisation sells dairy products such as curd and ghee(butter) in half- or one-litre packages. 
But, as consumers generally are more price-focused, there has been a huge demand for such products in $2 and $3 pack sizes. There are all different packages available for different products and their sizes with different prices ranging, so even middle-class family can afford easily. Usually pouch milk has highest turnover.  

###### Additionally, it has high quality products with reasonable prices. 

According to my experience, people have different tastes and choices, so we need to produce food according to them what they want. We provide products equally to its quality, the fresh products with reasonable prices.
